# this-is-my-project_front-end

It is my Front-End project with HTML, JavaScript, and SASS.


To start a program you can simply clone all respiratory files and project result you will see when open index.html.

The simplest way to edit the project with SASS - you need to move the style.css file to folder resource -> SCSS and change the CSS location in an HTML link tag.
